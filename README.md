Objective-C:  Double Linked List	
======================================
Developed in Xcode - September, 2011

This was a project to create a Double Linked List (DLL) in Objective-C.  This project creates the nodes in a DLL via the NodeFactory class.  It then runs the list through an algorithm to remove select nodes, then through another algorithm to sort the nodes.  This was a great learning tool when first starting with Objective-C.


What is a Double Linked List?
-------------------------------
A Double Linked List is a linked data structure that consists of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes. Each node contains two fields, called links, that are references to the previous and to the next node in the sequence of nodes. The beginning and ending nodes' previous and next links, respectively, point to some kind of terminator, typically a sentinel node or null, to facilitate traversal of the list. If there is only one sentinel node, then the list is circularly linked via the sentinel node. It can be conceptualized as two singly linked lists formed from the same data items, but in opposite sequential orders.
